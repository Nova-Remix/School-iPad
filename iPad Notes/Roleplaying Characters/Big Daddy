***Height:*** *8-feet, 2-inches*
***Build:*** *Pfft, he's a machine.*
***Eye Color:*** *He uses lights instead of eyes, and his lights have a variety of colors. Green, which means he's hypnotized or friendly.

***Likes:*** *Having a little sister, protecting them, making sure they don't get hurt.*
***Dislikes:*** *NOT having a little sister, getting attacked, people getting too close.*

*They roam the underwater dystopian city of Rapture, mentally conditioned to protect the Little Sisters—little girls who harvest a substance called ADAM from corpses—thanks to a series of plasmids stripping them of their humanity and free will. Conceived of early on as a man encased in a diving suit, the Big Daddy was designed to have "that hulking metal feel of an underwater protector, so solid not even a shotgun blast could knock him off his feet."*
