***Backstory:*** *Mio and his brother, Guardian, are very close, doing almost anything together. They were there for each other when they were kids, messing around, hunting, etc. But due to them losing their pack, Mio decided to become more of a 'DJ' type of wolf rather than wanting to hunt and hurt people, however, his brother seemed to become something totally different than what they were expecting.
