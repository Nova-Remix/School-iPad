***Backstory:*** *He and his sister, Wintry, were separated at birth. Ever since, he had been upset about a lot of things, causing him to think differently about what others say. He was used for experiments, but he attempted to fight back against the scientists. However, he was unable to and have horrible breakdowns. His breakdowns make him act differently, either crying, screaming, hiding, going to his sister for help or even just isolating himself.*

*He actually arrived AFTER Wintry had, meeting her soon after. They had talked and talked for a long while, then later finding out that they were actually related. He was finally happy for once. But he still has his visions, worst than the ones that his sister seems to get. They had finally managed to escape the lab, staying with Wintry the entire time and letting her know he would be there for her.*
