***Backstory:*** *Echo rushed to [REDACTED] ready to throw his arms around his beloved. [REDACTED], however, was appalled and, spurning him, exclaimed, ‘Hands off! May I die before you enjoy my body.’ All Echo could whisper in reply was, ‘enjoy my body’ and having done so he fled, scorned, humiliated, and shamed.

Despite the harshness of her rejection, Echo’s love for [REDACTED] only grew. When [REDACTED] died, wasting away before her own reflection, consumed by a love that could not be, Echo mourned over her body. When [REDACTED], looking one last time into the pool uttered, "Oh marvellous boy, I loved you in vain, farewell", Echo too chorused, "Farewell."

Eventually, Echo, too, began to waste away. His beauty faded, his skin shrivelled, and his bones turned to stone. Today, all that remains of Echo is the sound of his voice and sometimes even his ghostly appearance.*
***Powers:*** *Echo has the ability to fuck up anyone's mind, allowing them to hallucinate, see him only when he wants to, and can let others feel his emotions by looking into his eyes. Each color represents a new emotion for them to feel. Computers for him are the worst. He is like a virus, getting inside them and will wreck havoc. Though, he only does bad things when he makes an enemy. It's best to stay on his good side.*
