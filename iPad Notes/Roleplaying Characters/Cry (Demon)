Cry (Demon)

**Name**: Cry
**Gender**: Male, human
**Age**: 19
**Appearance**: He has bright neon green eyes (which seem to glow at night because of the color) and he has light brown hair. He usually wears a black hoodie with jeans and black shoes. He has a mask that he usually wears with white glowing eyes, neon green cheeks, and a flame decal on it that makes it look like the mask is actually on fire (the decal moves around). He also uses a machete with barb wire around the handle of it.
**Relatives**: Doesn't know.
**Friends/Enemies**: His parents are his enemies.
**Personality**: He is somewhat shy, also very careful about his surroundings and what people do. He is very well known to his surroundings, fast reflexes, and knows how to defend himself. He is flirty, but he hasn't had much experience. He was left alone as a child, which caused him to look for his parents and kill them. Ever since, he had been going on a killing spree.
**Backstory**: He does not know his mom or dad, as he was left by himself as a child. He is very good in the wilderness, setting traps, etc. He also can flirt, but he is shy (except when it comes to him killing people). When he was about 6-7, he was hit by a car, which changed his life around when it comes to safety. He goes by the name "Cry", mainly because that's what he made everyone around him do. He says he has no last name, but he refuses to tell anybody the truth. And now, he's basically a demon.
**Likes/Dislikes**: He dosen't like people using him for their good nature.
