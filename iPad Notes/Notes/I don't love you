I don't love you, I don't need you.
I don't ever want to see you again.
'cause girl, I moved on and things are perfect.
I'm okay with us just being friends.

'cause I don't think about you every single night; I'll be fine without you.
Can sleep tight when I'm not beside you; I'm moving on.
No, I don't cry about you; never seen tears in my eyes about you.
Gonna be fine if I die without you; Baby, I'm gone.

These are the lies that I tell myself at night.
These are the lies that are keeping me alive.
These are the lies.
