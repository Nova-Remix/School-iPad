***Species:*** *Jogauni*
***Appearance:*** *(Just look at the photo <3)*
***Personality:*** *She is shy, but also very loving. She can become nervous easily. She acts more like a real wolf than an a human.*
***Origin:*** *Born into the world as a water jogauni, she led fairly normal life in her tribal village with all her family, friends, and others of her tribe, the Pani. During a particularly harsh winter when she was twelve years of age, the female jogauni, Artica, wound up separated from her hunting party and had to seek refuge in a nearby cave as the cold winter night set in. The terrified young teen wandered into the cave to escape the dark cloudy skies, the first flakes of an incoming blizzard falling from the clouds above. Artica waited at the entrance of the cave for some time, looking around and shouting out for her friends until the wind started to pick up, howling into the cave with a bone-chilling coldness. She sought to flee the cold and went deeper and deeper into the cave, using her paws on the stone walls to guide herself while peering into the darkness ahead.*

*The further she travelled the more she say of a very faint light at the end of the path she had taken, the girl squinting and moving quicker now with the pit-pat sounds of her footpaws hitting the stony floor. Curious and slightly hopeful, she kept moving closer growing curious as to where the light was coming from. A few minutes later Artica stumbled into a large open room filled with a diffuse bluish-white light. She gazed around over the sparkling crystal of the stalactites and stalagmites adorning the area, moving past them until she came upon a grand flowstone in the center of the room. She gasped loudly and opened her eyes widely at the apparent sight of some strange, unusual creature floating on top of the crystal flowstone, several parts of the snowflake-shaped creature rotating slowly and giving off the faint blue glow. She stood there immobilized for what seemed like an eternity as she gazed unblinkingly over the elemental creature and finding herself strangely drawn toward it, holding up her paws as she approached slowly. The closer she got the loudly the faint clinking noise of ice hitting ice rung in her ears until she was suddenly engulfed in a blinding flash of light, the young jogauni crying out in surprise as she found herself completely immobilized is the creature’s presence. Icy tendrils of energy flowed outwards from the creature like snakes moving across the water, wrapping themselves around her body and pulling tight, intense pulses of frozen energy coursing through in waves, hitting Artica’s body as she convulsed and panted heavily. Gripped with fear Artica struggled against the ethereal hold the creature had on her, panting heavily until was seemed like hours had passed, the jogauni collapsing back to the ground after maybe a minute. She glanced up at the creature, watching the strange elemental being fading away into the darkness, growing smaller until it was wisked away into the darkness, returning from whence it came.*

***"Oh..ooh….what..happened…”*** *Artica groaned and closed her eyes, seated on her side with her paws on the cold, stony floor of the cave. She finally sat up and brought her paws up to her face, startled at the glowing light falling over them and noticing it was coming from her own two eyes after glancing into a small pool of water at the base of the flowstone.* ***“What?”*** *she said in a stuttering down as she kept her paws up, examining over herself. The water jogauni’s formerly smokey grey fur turned to a brilliant, pristine white over her arms, legs, paws, body tail and face…the blue fur along her back, the top of her tail and along the top of her muzzle transformed into a bright cyan.* ***“I need to get out of here…”*** *she muttered and rose back to her feet, glancing around as she could see a good deal better in the darkness now, coming back the way she came and eventually reaching the entrance of the cave again. She blinked a couple times and stared out into the cold dark night, a blizzard raging though finding it oddly comforting now, the jogauni no longer feeling cold as she walked out into the snowfall and wind, having an affinity for it with the power of ice instead of water flowing through her veins.*
***Abilities*** *She can freeze anything. If it's something very warm/hot, she can keep it frozen as long as she keeps blowing/touching it and activating the ability.*
***Likes:***'*She LOVES playing around with people, moror lessacting like an actual wolf. She likes people who are nice and treat people right. She also favors being pet, or even being someone pet in general.*
***Dislikes:*** *Disrespectful people, people getting too close without permission, basically just unwanted touch in general.*
***Other:***'*Her fur is VERY soft, and she is also very kind to others. Her breath also smells like fresh mints 24/7.*
