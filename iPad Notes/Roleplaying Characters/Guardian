Guardian

**Name:** *Guardian*
**Gender:** *Male (A wolf as well)*
**Age:** *17*
**Appearance:** *(Please see the picture provided)*
**Relatives:** *His brother, Mio*
**Personality:** *He is more of a protector than anything, saving others and stopping them from doing the wrong thing. He will fight if he needs to, but he doesn't seem to do it so often. He also intends to bring joy to most, having his ways at life.*
**Backstory:** *He and his brother Mio were close to the point where they couldn't let each other out of sight, always being there for one another and making sure they didn't do anything stupid. But >Guardian< and Mio had lost their pack, Mio becoming a 'DJ' and him become a 'Guardian'. He protected anyone as a kid, even his enemies as he stands for what is right, giving others a chance. He had lost most hope as Mio seemed to have been getting depressed easily, not knowing why it was happening.*
**Other:** *His eyes seem to be able to change, allowing people to feel fear, pain, joy, sadness, and more just by looking into them. However, he does not use this whenever he wishes. He also has a weird way of 'teleporting'. He can also heal others, but the problem with that is it drains his own energy, which could also kill him. He can also make things come alive, depending on what the size of it is. If it's a person, it could nearly kill him. If it's something smaller than a person, it could still hurt him but it wouldn't be as bad.*
**RPs used for:** *Random*
