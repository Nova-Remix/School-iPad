*The moon was bright and the stars were shining like never before, their gaze looking upon me sitting down on top of the hill. It was quite the something to see such a beautiful sight while being alone, all the noises being blocked out by all of my thoughts. I felt like I could reach up and touch the stars and hold one tight to create a small supernova in my hands, but then I opened my eyes and realized it was only a dream. I rubbed my eyes to hopefully be able to see correctly afterwards, after all I wasn't even wearing my glasses. I yawned and stretched my arms out as far as they could go, then a loud zapping sound came from outside. This whole time I never realized it was storming.


I swung my legs around to dangle off the edge of the bed, peering out the window. I could barely see anything, not because of me not wearing the glasses but because the rain was coming down hard. I stood up and walked over to the window, presses my nose gently up against it to hopefully get a better look outside. The only thing I could see was my parent's car sitting in the driveway and the only house on the block with their lights on. They probably had a generator or something. I backed away and I found my way over to the dresser in the dark, grabbing my glasses and sliding them on. What use would they have if I couldn't even see.


I rummage through the drawers to find my glow stick. I always kept one somewhere because my little brother always thought it would give me luck at night, and it so happens to be working for this night. Who would have thought? I glance snap the glow stick and the bright purple glow shines right into my eyes. I squint a bit and hold it out far in front of me to glow up the room, until a flash came from outside my window then a loud bang. Oh great, now it was thundering. The room went from dark and pink to a quick bright flash of white. The shadows of my stuffed animals rose upon the wall, then disappeared. There was no way I was leaving my room.*


*I make my way over to the wall and put my face up close to the writing and sniff. That was no ink, that was either real blood or fake blood. My eyes went wide and I quickly turn my head to the left to see two bodies laying on the ground. They were missing their eyes and had a smile carved into their face. They both also had a cut running down their right cheek, right below the carved smile; however, the cut was stitched up. Someone had murdered my parents and turned them into some sort of... I don't even know what to call it. I fall to my knees and cry, another flash coming into the room. I cover my face up with both of my hands and my body trembles as I rock back and forth while crying. I will get my revenge.


I heard the door creak open even more than it already was, then I heard a thud. I sniff quietly and raise my head up to see a third body. Still had no eyes and a smile along with that stitched up cut. My little brother was murdered as well... I scream and slam my fist into the ground. It felt like I broke one of my fingers or something. I stand back up and wipe my eyes with my left arm, still holding the glow stick in my right. I walk out of the room just in time. Another flash filled the hallway and i saw a figure standing by the top of the stairs, then the room fell dark. I scream and run over to where I saw the figure, jumping into the air and trying to drop kick whoever it was. I ended up failing and kicking a giant hole in the wall. Whoever this person was, they were swift when it comes to moving.


I get back up and brush off my shirt, looking around carefully and holding my glow stick out. Despite that I had a glow stick saved for so long, it was getting darker and darker. No wonder why I didn't see the person move, it's because the glow stick wasn't working anymore. The light grew dimmer and dimmer every minute. The glow stick finally decided to give out and I was standing there on top of the stairs, not knowing what to do or where to go. I was scared to the point where I sat down and cried again, hiding my face behind my hands as I rocked back and forth. I use to always think I could handle pain. I day dreamed of shoving a knife through my hand and feel nothing.*


I hear the floor creaking beside me and I sniff again as I rub my eyes. I peer up to see a figure standing above me with a black mask on that had neon green cheeks, sort of like jigsaw, with green flames painted on the sides. The mask also had the shape of a skull. At least the person killing me had style. He was holding a large machete that had barbed wire on the handle of it, which explained why he was wearing special gloves. He raised his machete up high in the dark, but then something strange happened. I hear our clock start dinging.* ***~~12:00 AM.~~*** *The man laughs behind his mask, drops the machete and takes the mask off. It was my neighbour. All I could hear after that was* ***"Happy Birthday".*** *The lights flicker back on and my family walks out of their room. They still had their eyes?*


*Their eyelids were painted to make it look like they didn't have eyes, their smile and stitched cut were also fake. The rest of my neighbours walk into the house, a whole crowd of people swarming the living room. This entire thing was just a sick joke for my birthday. I slowly stand up and walk back to my room, closing my door behind me. It wasn't raining or storming anymore. I look out my window to see a bunch of equipment outside. It was all fake... The murder, the storm, the messed up glowstick, everything. There was a giant flash camera outside to fake the lightning, speakers to fake the thunder, a hose dripping water outside my window and a fog machine, which was what made it hard to see things through the water. They were smart when it comes to pranking people, but it was fucked up.


I just sit there on my bed and cry. I cried for a while, long enough for everyone else to leave. The house that had the lights on was owned by my* ***"best friend."*** *I'm not even sure if she knew what was happening because she always stays inside. I'm the only one she talks to. I head back over to my door and open it, walking back out into the hallway and head to the stairs. My parents were asleep and so was my little brother. The neighbours left but they forgot all of their stuff. They were probably drunk. I slowly walked down the stairs and spot the gloves, mask and machete. I also notice a heavy black jacket and I start thinking to myself:* ***~~Every prank earns its payback.~~***


*I head over to the jacket and pick it up. It turns out it was folded. It wasn't a jacket, it was a trench coat. Now I can get revenge while looking like Sherlock Holmes. I slip the trench coat on and walk over to the machete. I think once more and go into my kitchen and instead grab a knife.* ***~~I'm going to regret this.~~*** *I put a knife up to my left eye and cut it out. I cover my mouth to muffle my screams. My right eye starts filling up with tears. I was only doing this to stop myself from crying all the time. I drop my left eye and begin cutting out my right eye. I start thinking about what my parents looked like when they faked their deaths.


I drop my right eye and the knife. I couldn't see anything but at the same time I could.This feeling was strange, obviously it wasn't normal. I slowly make my way back to the mask, counting each step I take. I feel around and whimper again, soon finding the mask and grabbing it. I slide it on and breathe heavily. This mask felt like it was glued onto my face, I couldn't even move it.* ***~~It was meant for me.~~*** *I could see again and it was scary. Everything was glowing... It was thermal vision. No wonder how the neighbour could see in the dark, but what was even more creepy was that I could still see without eyes. I felt a sharp pain shoot across my mouth, blood dripping down my chin and onto the floor. I bite down on something metal...* ***~~Razor Blades.~~*** *The mask had cut a smile into my face, but also put a cut across my right cheek that somehow got stitched.*


***~~I was chosen.~~*** *The mask now had white tears coming from the eye sockets to mimic me crying, but on the outside of the mask it looked like the eye sockets were glowing white. The mask changed into a black mask with white tears and glowing white eyes and neon green flames with blue cheeks instead of green.* ***~~This was meant to be.~~*** *I look over and pick up the machete. In the dark, all you would see are glowing white eyes and white tears flowing down the mask. Would be pretty scary to see. I head up the stairs quietly, the thermal helping me more than anything at this point. I walk over to the door of my parent's room and wrap my hand around the handle, turning it and opening the door quietly.*


My mask was no longer forming tears, which was a good thing for me. I was completely unaffected by pain that I didn't realize I wasn't wearing the gloves and the barbed wire was pricking through my hand. I walk over to the bed and stare down at my parents. They looked so peaceful...* ***~~I hate it.~~*** *I scream angrily and stab my mother with as much force as I could. It went right through her and the bed. I look over at my father who was now wide awake and staring in horror. I yank the machete out of my mother and immediately throw it at my father's head. I look away and hear his body fall off of the bed and onto the floor. Payback is a bitch. I look back and head over to his body, pulling the machete out of his head and carve out a smile on his face. I made them both look the same way they looked when they were fake dead.


I walk out of the bedroom and back down the stairs. I grab the gloves, drop the machete, slide the gloves on and picked the machete back up. I continued this night with murdering all of my neighbours. After I finished, I walked over to the house that my, so-called, best friend lived in. I fell onto my knees, dropping the sword beside me as my mask began to glow with white tears once more, mocking me crying. Surprisingly, my friend had come out and looked at me somehow knowing what I had done, but not the reason I had done it for. She came over to me, putting her hand gently onto my shoulder and she smiled.*


***"Come on..."*** *This was the only thing she said before lifting my machete up and carrying it inside the house for me while I remained on my knees. She's really willing to take in a murderer and give them Xenia?* ***~~(ξενία)~~*** *As long as I had someone who would not make fun of me for who I am, I will be happy. Little did I know I would soon lose her and be on the run to find someplace in the middle of the woods.*
